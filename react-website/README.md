The website presents some fun facts about my (for realz) cat - Pao Pao, and demonstrated some techniques I learned during this semester.

## Complex UI Elements
- There is a tab setup in the section `More about Pao Pao`.
- When the width of the site is less than 600px, the navigation bar will change to a dropdown menu (with animation effect).
- Adaptive changes for header, tab, and user management pages (either font size change, or flex direction change) to be sure the site is still usable when the width is 360px.

## Where to See Loading Indicator
- In the `Privacy` section, click `Get me a damn cute kitten!`.

## Licenses for Images
- Logo is from my own cat.
- Other cats are from placekitten.com.
- The loading indication is from font-awesome.

# Detailed Description
- The site is a SPA using `create-react-app`.
- The site has five (5) distinct views with completely different contents.
- There is a form in the `Contact Pao Pao` section, with four input fields and validation, and the data is stored once submitted, and shown at the bottom part of the same page. Try it out!
- The site contains complex UIs as mentioned above.
- The site has navigation that allows both mouse and keyboard navigation.
- The site has a loading indicator as mentioned above.
- The site has a CSS animation as mentioned above.
- All views of the site should work even if the width is down to 360px.
- Semantic HTML is used.
- Skip link is included.
- Both keyboard and mouse can be used to navigate through the site.

# Extra Credit
- This site interacted with both real and fake services.
- This site interacted with the fake services to provide a simple register/sign-in/logout mechanism. Try it out!
- The register/sign-in/logout mechanism contains some validations as defined in the code.
- This site interacted with a real service from placekitten.com to get random cats from it and show loading indicators while we're at it.
